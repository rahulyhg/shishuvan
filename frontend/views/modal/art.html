        <h5>The Arts</h5>
        <p>The school offers a wide ambit of art programmes â€“ from visual art to music to dramatics. Through the arts we actively
            stimulate innovative thinking and problem-solving skills that enrich personal growth. We also give students a
            foundation in creative expression that will allow them to take full advantage of new learning opportunities,
            and showcase their ability.</p>
