                <h5>Early Years Curriculum</h5>
                <p>Our early years curriculum comprises the following classes: Nursery – Junior Kindergarten – Senior Kindergarten.
                    </p>
                <p> The Early Years Program (EYP) consists of the first years of school life (ages 3 to 5). In the EYP, we aim
                    to provide a safe and stimulating environment in which children can develop socially, emotionally, creatively,
                    physically and academically and provide a broad, balanced an relevant curriculum.</p>
                <p> In Early Years our academic programme is based on developmentally appropriate practice with an emphasis on
                    your child’s social-emotional development and wellbeing.
                </p>
                <p> We begin preparing children for structured daily
                    routines by facilitating activities that allow for logical reasoning, critical thinking and problem-solving
                    strategies. Activities are based around themes and topics as well as children’s interests and needs.
                    All areas of the curriculum are supported through large and small group sessions with both planned and
                    spontaneous child-initiated activities. Through indoor and outdoor play, children become confident in
                    their own learning, are able to take risks, are effective communicators and can articulate their thoughts,
                    feelings and ideas to others. Children are exposed to phonics, reading and writing simple words. To understand
                    a growing range of simple mathematical concepts, children are exposed to recalling number symbols, shapes
                    and patterns.
