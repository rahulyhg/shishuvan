                    <h5>Early Years Curriculum</h5>
                    <p>Our early years curriculum comprises the following classes: Nursery – Junior Kindergarten – Senior Kindergarten.
                    </p>
                    <p> The Early Years Program (EYP) consists of the first years of school life (ages 3 to 5). In the EYP, we
                        aim to provide a safe and stimulating environment in which children can develop socially, emotionally,
                        creatively, physically and academically and provide a broad, balanced an relevant curriculum.</p>
                    <p> In Early Years our academic programme is based on developmentally appropriate practice with an emphasis
                        on your child’s social-emotional development and wellbeing.

                <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
                    <p> We begin preparing children for structured daily routines by facilitating activities that allow for logical
                        reasoning, critical thinking and problem-solving strategies. Activities are based around themes and
                        topics as well as children’s interests and needs. All areas of the curriculum are supported through
                        large and small group sessions with both planned and spontaneous child-initiated activities. Through
                        indoor and outdoor play, children become confident in their own learning, are able to take risks,
                        are effective communicators and can articulate their thoughts, feelings and ideas to others. Children
                        are exposed to phonics, reading and writing simple words. To understand a growing range of simple
                        mathematical concepts, children are exposed to recalling number symbols, shapes and patterns.

                <p>Through play, your child will explore their immediate environment and begin to make sense of the world around
                    them. There are opportunities for indoor and outdoor learning, engagement in sensory exploration activities
                    and opportunities to develop creative and motor skills in different ways. There are role-play opportunities
                    for children to develop their communication skills and story-times where language will be continually
                    extended. The language-rich environment provides multiple experiences for each child’s verbal and non-verbal
                    communication skills to grow.

                    <p>The Primary School comprises Grades 1 to 5. In this section, we plan to offer the Cambridge Primary Curriculum.
                        A wide range of subjects including Mathematics, English, Hindi, Marathi, Science, Humanities, ICT
                        (Computers), Visual Arts, Music and Physical Education will be offered in this section. Our children
                        follow inquiry-based units focused on; looking after the environment; internationalism; entrepreneurial
                        understanding; and a reflection on the past. Each year children will take part in a community project
                        as we aim to prepare them for life as responsible global citizens and foster the desire to contribute
                        to their local communities. Our school environment encourages and empowers young students to ask
                        questions, safe to meet challenges head on, and accompanied on their journey towards reaching their
                        full potential. This is a time in which to instill a love of learning that children will carry with
                        them throughout their lives. Classes are small, taught by expert staff making personalised learning
                        a reality. Our teaching pedagogy ensures that students actively participate and engage in lessons,
                        and develop personally as well as academically. Success is celebrated, and students emerge as confident,
                        curious and enthusiastic learners.
