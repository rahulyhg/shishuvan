                        it is critical that educational institutions also change and adapt to prepare students for an uncertain
                        future. The ShishuVihar School has been planned with this broad aim in mind. Our logo captures this
                        very spirit with our tagline – Legacy of Knowledge… Roots of Virtue. We consider education to be
                        a catalyst towards developing our children into change makers who can help us as a community and
                        a nation to find solutions to our common problems.</p>
